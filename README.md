- Please re-call that the Flixpal.com is a mobile first platform, so design for mobile
- Please also remove all un-used imports where possible
- Implement DRY(Don't repeat yourself)

Due to reasons on the basis of being cheap. The repo connected to the hosting provider is connected to Ronald Kelechi's Github  Account.
